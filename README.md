# News
**2024-3-29** The initial release, i.e., the <strong><font color=green>Demo Code</font></strong> is available. The <strong><font color=red>Training Code</font></strong> is on the way. For more details, pleaase check out <a href="https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/ash/"><strong>the project page</strong></a>:smiley:.

# Installation
### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:kv2000/ASH.git --recursive

cd ./submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization/
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
### Install the dependencies

The code is tested on ```Python 3.9```, ```pytorch 1.12.1```, and ```cuda 11.3```.


#### Setup DeepCharacters Pytorch

Firstly, install the underlying clothed human body model, :fireworks:<a href="https://github.com/kv2000/DeepCharacters_Pytorch"><strong>DeepCharacters Pytorch</strong></a>:fireworks:, which also consists the dependencies that needed for this repo.

#### Setup 3DGS

Then, setup the submodules for <a href="https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting"><strong>3D Gaussian Splatting</strong></a>.

```bash
# the env with DeepCharacters Pytorch
conda activate mpiiddc 

# 3DGS go
cd ./submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization/
python setup.py install

cd ../simple-knn/
python setup.py install
```

## Setup the metadata and checkpoints
You may find the metadata and the checkpoints <a href="https://gvv-assets.mpi-inf.mpg.de/ASH/"><strong>from this link</strong></a>. 

The extracted metadata and checkpoints follows folder structure below

```bash
# for the checkpoints
checkpoints
--- Subject0001
    |---deformable_character_checkpoint.pth # character checkpoints
    |---gaussian_checkpoints.tar            # gaussian checkpoints

# for the meta data
meta_data
|--- Subject0001
    |---skeletoolToGTPose                   # training poses
    |   |--- ... 
    |
    |---skeletoolToGTPoseTest               # Testing poses
    |   |--- ...
    |
    |---skeletoolToGTPoseRetarget           # Retartget another subject's pose
    |   |--- ...
    |
    |--- ...                                # Others

```

# Run the demo 
Run the following and the results will be stored in ```./dump_results/``` by default.

```bash
bash run_inference.sh
```
